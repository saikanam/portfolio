# Welcome, traveler beyond the fog!

Hark, Tarnished One! I am Saik, a humble wanderer in these Lands Between. Schooled in the arcane arts of Computer Science, I've toiled in realms called Intel, NASA, and Allegro. I wield the tongues of Python, C++, and more, crafting modest tools to aid our fractured world. Though my skills are but a candle to the darkness that surrounds us, I offer them in service to our cause.

Now, I stand at the crossroads of fate, a Tarnished seeking purpose. I offer what meager skills I possess in service to our cause. Should you find use for one such as I, I would be honored to walk this perilous path alongside you. 

> [!IMPORTANT] Open to Work Starting Jan 2025

I will try my earnest to make the world a gentler place. A thousand year voyage; guided by compassion. 

May grace guide us all in these troubled times.
